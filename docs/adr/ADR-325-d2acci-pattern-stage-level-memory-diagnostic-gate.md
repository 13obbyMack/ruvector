## Context

Wave-3 evidence review grades this paper **A** —
[arXiv:2608.17756](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.17756), "D²ACCI: A Dual-Loop
Diagnostic Protocol for Evidence-Preserving Agent Memory," submitted
2026-08-18 (v1), revised 2026-08-19 (v2). **"D²ACCI (Dual-Loop Diagnostic
Protocol for evidence-preserving agent memory)" is spelled out here on first
use; every subsequent reference to D²ACCI in this program's documents should
do the same, following the same discipline ADR-307 applies to TARL
(Transaction-Aware Reliable Ledgers).**

Confirmed mechanism, verbatim against the abstract: a dual-loop design — an
**inner loop**, the actual memory-augmented-agent execution, and an **outer
loop**, a "diagnostic gate [that] promotes, feature-flags, or rejects memory
interventions based on paired evidence, protected-slice monitoring, and
trace-level localizability." The paper instantiates this in a reference
system, "MemStack," and introduces two supporting artifacts: DCR, a graded
observability metric, and D²ACCI-Eval, a reusable gate-replay artifact.

Numbers (verbatim, exact match to the program brief, plus one bonus figure
not in the original brief that this ADR does not drop): **93.59% on LoCoMo,
90.93% on LongMemEval, and 57.20% on PersonaMem-V2.** Ablations, verbatim:
"Five paired ablations show that supplement extraction, session-memory
retrieval, and Forget Guard yield statistically significant gains (+1.9 to
+3.7pp, all p ≤ .003)." Notably, the paper's own fifth ablation is a negative
result worth citing precisely *because* it demonstrates the gate working as
designed: **"BM25/RRF is retained as a monitored feature flag"** — i.e. this
intervention did not clear the bar for full promotion and was correctly held
back rather than promoted, the diagnostic gate's own worked example of
rejecting a weak intervention rather than promoting everything it evaluates.
DCR figure, verbatim: "Diagnostic artifacts reach 98–100% DCR@3 versus 0% for
results-only logs."

**Artifact availability — checked, not assumed: no code found.** The arXiv
page has no Comments field and no code/data URL. A targeted GitHub search for
"MemStack" and "D2ACCI"/"D2ACCI-Eval" surfaced only unrelated projects (a
Claude Code skill framework, a C memory-allocation library, a flash-card app,
student course exercises) and two research-digest blog posts summarizing the
abstract — neither an authors' repository. This ADR is therefore a
**first-party build from the paper's description**, the same posture ADR-319
(TRUSS) and ADR-318 (StagedWorkspace) already take for their own
no-code sources.

**Name collision — low risk.** "D²ACCI" itself is distinctive; no
conflicting project was found. "MemStack" collides with generic unrelated
repos in a targeted search — low risk, but this program does not adopt
"MemStack" as its own package or module name regardless, to avoid
reintroducing the exact ambiguity ADR-320's MemFuse naming discipline exists
to prevent for an adjacent memory-system name.

ADR-307 already formalizes `ruvector`'s three memory tiers (working context,
continuous latent state, transactional RuVector memory via TARL's
five-operation ledger). ADR-320 already adds `AtomicObservation` records and
a causal episodic graph on top of the continuous-latent-state tier,
consumed as evidence by ADR-310's causal-attribution gate. **D²ACCI's
genuinely new contribution sits underneath both**: `ruvector` ADR-282's
`research-gate` (adopted by this program via ADR-306) already performs
**outcome-level** gating — did the mutation's measured end-result improve?
D²ACCI's dual-loop diagnostic protocol is **stage-level** — when a memory
intervention regresses or fails to improve, which of the memory pipeline's
five distinct stages (ingestion, extraction, retrieval, filtering,
generation) is responsible? This is a different axis of diagnosis, not a
duplicate of research-gate's existing outcome-level promotion decision, and
this ADR does not replace `research-gate` — it adds a complementary,
finer-grained fault-localization layer underneath it.

**Preprint-reproduction rule** (applies uniformly across this program, per
`09-wave3-program-plan.md`): D²ACCI's reported figures (93.59% / 90.93% /
57.20%, and the +1.9–3.7pp ablation deltas) are the source paper's own
measurements on its own benchmark suite (LoCoMo, LongMemEval, PersonaMem-V2)
against its own reference implementation (MemStack) — not a promotion bar
this program is entitled to claim without its own `research-gate`-recomputed
paired-bootstrap delta. Every reported gain is a hypothesis until this
program's own benchmark confirms it, exactly as ADR-317 already states for
HarnessRisk and ADR-324 now states for SPADE.

## Decision

Make every RuVector memory strategy an **immutable versioned policy
artifact**, gated by a stage-level diagnostic protocol informed by D²ACCI's
mechanism (arXiv:2608.17756):

1. **Immutable versioned memory-strategy artifacts.** Each retrieval
   algorithm, ingestion pipeline, extraction rule, filtering policy, and
   generation strategy in ADR-307's memory tiers becomes an immutable,
   versioned artifact — a candidate mutation, not a strategy mutated in
   place. This gives every memory change a stable identity to diagnose
   against and promote/reject as a unit, mirroring how ADR-313 already
   treats harness/skill mutations as versioned candidates rather than
   in-place edits.
2. **A memory mutation promotes only when three conditions hold jointly**,
   following D²ACCI's confirmed dual-loop pattern: (a) paired evaluation
   (this program's existing `research-gate` paired-bootstrap statistics,
   `crates/ruvector-sota-bench/harness/src/statistics.ts`) shows genuine
   improvement; (b) protected workloads — a held-out slice of existing
   memory-dependent tasks the mutation is not tuned against — do not
   regress, mirroring D²ACCI's confirmed "protected-slice monitoring"; and
   (c) failure provenance, when the mutation does regress, stays
   **localizable to exactly one of the five memory-pipeline stages**
   (ingestion / extraction / retrieval / filtering / generation) rather than
   surfacing only as an undifferentiated end-to-end score drop. All three
   conditions are required; any one failing blocks promotion.
3. **Retrieval algorithms become Darwin candidates.** HNSW, graph-based
   retrieval, BM25, temporal retrieval, attractor-based retrieval, and
   learned retrieval strategies are each registered as Darwin mutation
   candidates under ADR-313's existing harness-evolution loop, evaluated
   through this ADR's stage-level gate before promotion — exactly the
   correctly-cautious posture D²ACCI's own BM25/RRF ablation models: a
   plausible-sounding retrieval strategy is a monitored feature flag, not an
   automatic promotion, until it clears the joint bar in Decision §2.
4. **Stage-level diagnosis is complementary to, not a replacement for,
   `research-gate`'s existing outcome-level gate (ADR-282, adopted via
   ADR-306).** A memory-strategy candidate must still clear
   `research-gate`'s ordinary outcome-level promotion path; this ADR adds a
   finer-grained, stage-localized diagnostic requirement on top, specific to
   the memory pipeline's five-stage structure, which `research-gate`'s
   general-purpose statistics do not model.
5. **First-party build, no code to adapt.** Because no reference
   implementation of D²ACCI or MemStack was found, this program implements
   the dual-loop diagnostic protocol, the DCR observability metric, and a
   D²ACCI-Eval-style gate-replay artifact from the paper's described
   mechanism, the same from-scratch posture ADR-318 and ADR-319 already take
   for their own no-code sources — not a port of existing code.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Gives the memory subsystem a genuine stage-level fault-localization
  capability that `research-gate`'s existing outcome-level statistics do not
  provide today — a regression can be attributed to ingestion, extraction,
  retrieval, filtering, or generation specifically, rather than only "the
  end-to-end score got worse."
- The three-condition joint-promotion bar (paired improvement, protected-slice
  non-regression, single-stage localizability) gives ADR-307's and ADR-320's
  memory tiers a structural defense against a mutation that improves one
  metric while silently regressing another workload — the exact failure
  mode D²ACCI's protected-slice monitoring is designed to catch.
- Treating retrieval algorithms as first-class Darwin candidates, evaluated
  against this gate, directly extends ADR-313's harness-evolution loop and
  ADR-321's/ADR-324's candidate-source pattern into the memory subsystem
  specifically, without inventing a parallel mutation-governance mechanism.
- D²ACCI's own BM25/RRF ablation gives this program a concrete, cite-able
  worked example of the gate correctly declining to promote a plausible but
  unproven intervention — a template this program's own gate implementation
  can be validated against.

### Negative

- No reference implementation exists for either D²ACCI or MemStack; this
  program's stage-level diagnostic gate, DCR metric, and gate-replay artifact
  are all first-party builds whose behavioral fidelity to the paper's
  reported properties (98–100% DCR@3, the five-ablation deltas) is unverified
  until independently tested against this program's own benchmarks — the
  same open-ended validation burden ADR-307 already carries for LiveMem and
  TARL, and ADR-318/ADR-319 carry for their own no-code sources.
- A joint three-condition promotion bar is stricter, and more expensive to
  evaluate, than a single outcome-level statistical test — every memory
  mutation now requires protected-slice replay and stage-localization
  analysis in addition to `research-gate`'s existing paired-bootstrap
  evaluation, adding CI/evaluation latency to the memory-mutation path
  specifically.
- Stage-level localizability is itself a design and validation challenge:
  a memory pipeline's five stages are not always cleanly separable in a real
  implementation (e.g. a retrieval-stage change can shift what the filtering
  stage sees), and this ADR does not itself resolve how boundary cases are
  attributed — that is left to the owning work package's implementation.
- Depends on ADR-307's memory tiers and ADR-320's `AtomicObservation`/causal
  graph existing first, since stage-level provenance needs both a tiered
  memory substrate and per-observation causal parentage to localize a
  failure to a specific stage.

## Security / Validation Gates

- **Joint three-condition promotion gate (this ADR's core mechanism)**:
  paired-evaluation improvement, protected-slice non-regression, and
  single-stage failure localizability are all independently required; any
  one failing blocks promotion of a memory-strategy artifact, blocking not
  advisory.
- **Immutability and versioning**: a memory-strategy artifact, once
  promoted, is never mutated in place; a change is always a new versioned
  candidate evaluated by this gate, giving every promoted (or rejected)
  memory strategy an auditable version history.
- **Protected-slice isolation**: the protected workload slice used for
  non-regression testing is held separate from the slice a candidate
  mutation is tuned or evaluated against, mirroring the held-out task
  isolation ADR-324 requires for its own acceptance criterion.
- **Witness-chain requirement**: every promotion, rejection, and
  feature-flag decision made by this gate, plus its stage-localization
  verdict, emits an RVM witness record (ruvector ADR-134 schema), anchored
  via this program's shared witness/anchoring contract (ADR-312).
- **Complementary to, not a substitute for, `research-gate` (ADR-282, via
  ADR-306)**: this gate's stage-level pass does not itself constitute a
  passed outcome-level promotion; a candidate must clear both.
- **Standard repo gate**: `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest security scan` after
  any change to the diagnostic gate's write path or the memory-strategy
  version registry.

## Affected Repos

- `ruvnet/ruvector` only — `crates/ruvector-agent-memory/src/{ledger.rs,
  observation.rs, fusion.rs, scoring.rs}` (ADR-307's TARL ledger, ADR-320's
  causal-graph fusion, and the scoring surface this gate's joint
  three-condition check extends) and `scripts/research-gate/research_gate.py`
  (new diagnostic-trace consumer, layered underneath the existing
  paired-bootstrap statistics), plus registered retrieval-algorithm
  candidates in `crates/ruvector-sota-bench/harness`. Single-repo scope, per
  `09-wave3-program-plan.md`.

## Dependencies

Depends on ADR-307 (the three-level memory tiers this gate governs
mutations against) and ADR-320 (the `AtomicObservation`/causal-graph
provenance this gate's stage-localization requirement relies on). Sits
underneath and complements, but does not depend on, `research-gate`
(ruvector ADR-282, adopted via ADR-306) — the outcome-level gate continues
to operate unchanged; this ADR adds a stage-level layer alongside it.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Rely on `research-gate`'s existing outcome-level statistics alone,
  without a stage-level diagnostic layer**: rejected — outcome-level
  statistics can confirm *that* a memory mutation regressed but not *which
  stage* caused it, leaving every regression a from-scratch investigation;
  D²ACCI's confirmed dual-loop mechanism is adopted specifically to close
  that gap.
- **Promote a memory-strategy candidate on paired-evaluation improvement
  alone, without protected-slice monitoring**: rejected — this is exactly
  the failure mode D²ACCI's protected-slice monitoring exists to catch: an
  intervention that improves the metric it is tuned against while silently
  regressing an unrelated protected workload.
- **Treat D²ACCI's reported figures (93.59%/90.93%/57.20%, +1.9–3.7pp) as
  this program's own expected result**: rejected, per the preprint-
  reproduction rule — those are the source paper's own numbers on its own
  benchmark suite and reference implementation; only this program's
  `research-gate`-measured delta may be cited as this program's result.
- **Adopt "MemStack" as this program's own module or package name**:
  rejected — while lower-risk than ADR-320's MemFuse collision, reusing an
  adjacent memory-system name invites exactly the kind of casual-reference
  ambiguity this program's naming discipline exists to prevent.

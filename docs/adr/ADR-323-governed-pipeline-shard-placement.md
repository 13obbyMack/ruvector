## Numbering note — why this ADR is 323, not 322

**This ADR is deliberately numbered ADR-323. `ruvector`'s own ADR-322 number
is skipped, not merely left unused by coincidence.** The reason is a
cross-repo citation-ambiguity risk this program has already hit four
separate times (per ADR-305 §6 and ADR-313's Context: the "metaharness
ADR-322" misattribution, the ADR-150 misattribution, and two further
instances documented in `04-verification-addendum.md` §5, §8c, §8d) —
assuming the wrong repo owns an ADR number before checking.

**`ruflo` ADR-322** (with children 322A/322B/322C) is the single
most-cited external ADR in this program: ADR-305, ADR-306, ADR-310,
ADR-312, and ADR-313 all cite it by number, repeatedly, as the
flywheel-receipt/promotion-separation authority this program has adopted
(the `Promote = Better ∧ Safe ∧ Authorized ∧ Reversible` separation-of-powers
invariant, and the canonical-encoding/domain-separated-Ed25519 witness
format ADR-312 adopted). A `ruvector`-local ADR-322 for pipeline-sharded
serving would **not** be a literal filename collision — `ruflo`'s ADR-322
lives in a different repo's `v3/docs/adr/` tree — but it would put two
heavily-cited, differently-scoped "ADR-322"s in **concurrent use across
sibling repos of the same program**, which is exactly the ambiguity ADR-305
§4 requires every cross-repo reference to avoid, and exactly the failure
mode ADR-316's disambiguation-by-slug citation rule (`ADR-NNN (slug)` for
duplicated numbers) exists to catch when it happens *within* one repo.
Skipping the number in `ruvector` avoids manufacturing the ambiguity in the
first place, rather than relying on every future author to apply ADR-316's
disambiguation rule correctly every single time this ADR is cited.

Per **`docs/adr/INDEX.md`** (as of the numbering check performed for this
ADR set, PR #857's regenerated index at 348 entries) and ADR-316's policy
that "allocated" includes numbers claimed on open ADR-authoring branches,
`ruvector` ADR-322 is treated as **reserved-but-unused** for this reason,
and **ADR-323** is the number this program allocates for pipeline-shard
placement. Every citation of the `ruflo` ADR elsewhere in this document, and
in every other PIR document, uses the repo-qualified form **"ruflo
ADR-322"**, per ADR-316's citation rule. ADR-316's collision-check tooling
(`scripts/adr-index.mjs --check`) gates on duplicate numbers, not on gaps in
the sequence, so this deliberate skip does not trip that gate — confirmed
against ADR-316's own Decision §5 (the check "exits non-zero if `docs/adr/`
contains a duplicate plain number," not an unused one).

## Context

Wave-2 evidence review grades this paper **A** — the strongest-evidence item
in the wave — [arXiv:2608.19147](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.19147),
"Pre-Compiled Pipeline Shards for Distributed LLM Inference on Intel AI PC
Fleets," submitted 2026-08-19. Every claim the Wave-2 brief cited checks out
verbatim against the abstract, with one important precision correction:

- **OpenVINO precompiled per-stage shards**, with a specific optimization
  detail beyond the brief's summary: a naive per-stage export "misses an
  OpenVINO GPU optimization," and injecting a `beam_idx` Gather into each
  shard triggers the `IndirectKVCache` fusion, bringing shards to parity
  with the unsplit model.
- **Speculative decoding on stateful OpenVINO models** — confirmed.
- **1.79× concurrent throughput** — abstract, verbatim: "a two-node Llama
  3.1 8B INT4 pipeline serves two concurrent users at 1.79x the single-user
  throughput of the unsplit model on the same hardware." **This figure
  applies only to the two-node, Llama-3.1-8B-INT4 configuration.**
- **Four-node Lunar Lake, 70B model** — abstract, verbatim: "a four-node
  deployment of Lunar Lake AI PCs on Intel Tiber Cloud serves a single user
  at interactive speed, with output token-for-token identical to the same
  four-node pipeline decoding without speculation." This is a **separate
  result**, reported in the paper's full text as 5.72 tok/s single-stream at
  72.2% accept rate and 6.43 tok/s aggregate two-stream — **no 1.79× figure
  is attached to this configuration.**

**Precision requirement (binding on this ADR and every derived work
package or status report)**: the Wave-2 brief's phrasing conflated these
into what reads as one combined result. They are two separate results in
the source paper. This ADR, WP20, and any downstream citation must state the
1.79× figure as specific to the **2-node/8B** configuration, and the
4-node/70B feasibility result as a **separate**, non-1.79×-labeled target —
never combined into one headline number.

**Artifact availability — checked, not assumed, and the strongest of the
six papers in this wave**: the abstract states, "Code, raw benchmark logs,
and reproduction scripts ship as a self-contained package at
`github.com/labscommunity/pipeline-sharded-inference-paper` (in the
top-level `reproduction/` directory)." Verified directly via the GitHub API:
public, 653 KB, last pushed 2026-08-19T16:59:13Z. The `reproduction/`
directory was checked directly and contains `CLAIMS.md`, `HARDWARE.md`,
`MODELS.md`, `RESULTS.md`, `configs/`, and `scripts/` — a genuine,
structured reproduction package, not a code dump. This ADR adapts this
released reproduction package rather than rebuilding from the paper alone.

**Name collision**: no significant collision found for "pipeline-sharded
inference" or the paper's likely short names in a targeted search.

ADR-314 already implements `ruvllm`'s closed-form linear KV-cache mapper for
**cross-model** migration within a single node (`kv_cache.rs`,
`paged_attention.rs`, `serving/kv_cache_manager.rs`). This ADR is a distinct
serving-layer improvement — pipeline parallelism **across nodes** with
pre-compiled per-stage graphs and speculative decoding — addressing
multi-node topology, not cross-model cache reuse. It ships independently of
ADR-314 but touches the same `crates/ruvllm` serving surface and the same
files, requiring coordination to avoid merge conflicts (per
`07-wave2-program-plan.md`'s WP20 repo assignment).

## Decision

Implement governed, pre-compiled pipeline-shard placement in `crates/ruvllm`
for heterogeneous multi-node ruvLLM serving fleets, adapting the confirmed-
live `labscommunity/pipeline-sharded-inference-paper` reproduction package
(arXiv:2608.19147):

1. **Pre-compile per-stage shards** using the paper's confirmed
   OpenVINO-equivalent approach: export each pipeline stage as a precompiled
   graph, and apply the `beam_idx` Gather injection needed to trigger
   `IndirectKVCache`-equivalent fusion so sharded stages reach parity with
   the unsplit model rather than silently regressing on a naive per-stage
   export.
2. **Shard placement across a multi-node fleet is governed by an explicit
   placement policy**, weighing:
   - **Latency** — inter-node communication cost for a given shard
     assignment.
   - **Cost** — resource/compute cost of the candidate placement.
   - **Trust** — node attestation and witness status (per this program's
     existing RVM witness-chain discipline, ADR-134/ADR-312) — an
     unattested or under-trusted node is not eligible to host a shard
     carrying sensitive state.
   - **Data residency** — placement constraints where shard state must not
     cross a residency boundary.
   - **Hardware capability** — a shard is only placed on hardware confirmed
     capable of running it (matching model/quantization requirements, per
     the paper's own INT4/Lunar-Lake hardware specificity).
   Placement is not a single greedy optimization over one of these axes; a
   candidate placement is rejected if it fails any hard constraint (trust,
   residency, hardware capability) regardless of its latency/cost score.
3. **Implement speculative decoding on stateful sharded models**, per the
   paper's confirmed mechanism, as the path to the 4-node/70B interactive-
   serving target.
4. **Target the two benchmark results separately, per the precision
   requirement above**: the internal 2-node/8B-class same-family setup
   targets the verified 1.79× concurrent-throughput figure; the 4-node/70B
   configuration targets single-user interactive-speed serving via
   speculative decoding (the paper's 5.72/6.43 tok/s figures as reference
   points), reported and evaluated as a wholly separate benchmark, never
   combined with the 1.79× figure into one number.
5. Coordinates with ADR-314/WP13 on the shared `crates/ruvllm` surface
   (`kv_cache.rs`, `paged_attention.rs`, `serving/kv_cache_manager.rs`) to
   avoid merge conflicts — the two ADRs are independent in scope (multi-node
   topology vs. cross-model cache reuse) but touch the same files.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The confirmed-live reproduction package (`CLAIMS.md`, `HARDWARE.md`,
  `MODELS.md`, `RESULTS.md`, `configs/`, `scripts/`) makes this the
  best-evidenced port-and-adapt effort across both Wave 1 and Wave 2 — WP20
  has a genuine, structured reference to adapt from, not a from-scratch
  build.
- Governing shard placement on trust/residency/hardware, not just
  latency/cost, extends this program's existing witness-chain and isolation
  disciplines (ADR-134, ADR-312, the hosted-RVM honesty discipline from
  ruvector ADR-285) into the serving-placement layer, rather than treating
  placement as a pure performance-optimization problem.
- Explicitly separating the 1.79× and 4-node/70B results prevents this
  program from over-claiming a combined figure that does not exist in the
  source paper — directly closing the conflation flag the evidence review
  raised.

### Negative

- Deliberately skipping ADR-322 in `ruvector`'s numbering sequence is a
  one-time deviation from the "always allocate from true max + 1" default
  ADR-316 otherwise establishes — every future numbering-hygiene pass over
  this repo's ADR sequence must be aware this is an intentional skip with a
  documented rationale, not an accidental gap or an error to "fix" by
  renumbering ADR-323 down to 322.
- Governed placement (trust/residency/hardware hard constraints) is
  additional engineering surface beyond the paper's own reproduction
  package, which does not itself model a multi-tenant, multi-trust-level
  fleet — this program's placement-policy layer is net-new work on top of
  the ported shard-compilation mechanism.
- Shares `kv_cache.rs`, `paged_attention.rs`, and
  `serving/kv_cache_manager.rs` with ADR-314/WP13 — real merge-conflict risk
  if the two work packages are not coordinated, even though neither
  blocks the other functionally.

## Security / Validation Gates

- **Trust/residency/hardware hard constraints**: a candidate shard placement
  failing any of these three is rejected outright, regardless of its
  latency/cost score.
- **Witness-chain requirement**: node trust/attestation status consumed by
  the placement policy is verified via this program's existing RVM witness
  chain (ADR-134, anchored per ADR-312), not a separately-trusted signal.
- **Precision citation discipline**: the 1.79× figure is always cited as
  specific to the 2-node/8B-class configuration; the 4-node/70B result is
  always cited separately, never combined into one headline number.
- **Cross-repo numbering discipline**: every reference to `ruflo`'s ADR-322
  (or its children 322A/322B/322C) in this ADR or any derived document uses
  the repo-qualified form "ruflo ADR-322," per ADR-316's citation rule;
  `ruvector` ADR-322 remains permanently unused and unreserved for any other
  purpose.
- **Proof-gated promotion**: this capability's rollout follows the same
  `ruvector-proof-gate`/`rvm-proof` promotion path as ADR-314's KV-cache
  migration work — not exempt from standard promotion gating merely because
  it ships on an independent schedule.
- **Standard repo gate**: `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest security scan` after
  any change to `kv_cache.rs`, `paged_attention.rs`, or
  `serving/kv_cache_manager.rs`, since both this ADR and ADR-314 touch a
  security-sensitive serving-path component.

## Affected Repos

- `ruvnet/ruvector` only — `crates/ruvllm` (`kv_cache.rs`,
  `paged_attention.rs`, `serving/kv_cache_manager.rs` — same files ADR-314/
  WP13 touches; coordinate to avoid merge conflicts). Single-repo scope per
  `07-wave2-program-plan.md`.

## Dependencies

Depends on ADR-314 sharing the same `crates/ruvllm` serving surface — no
hard blocking dependency; can start immediately in parallel, the same
independent-parallel-track pattern ADR-314 itself used relative to the rest
of Wave 1's critical path. No dependency on ADR-317 through ADR-321 — this
ADR is not part of the Wave-2 combined acceptance test.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Allocate ADR-322 in `ruvector` for this decision, relying on ADR-316's
  disambiguation-by-slug rule to prevent confusion with `ruflo` ADR-322**:
  rejected — see the Numbering note above; ADR-322 is this program's
  single most-cited external ADR number, and manufacturing a second,
  differently-scoped "ADR-322" in concurrent use is a self-inflicted version
  of exactly the ambiguity ADR-305 §4 and ADR-316 exist to prevent, even
  though the disambiguation rule would technically resolve it after the
  fact.
- **Place shards by latency/cost optimization alone, without trust/
  residency/hardware hard constraints**: rejected — this would treat
  placement as a pure performance problem and silently allow a shard
  carrying sensitive state onto an unattested or residency-inappropriate
  node whenever doing so improved latency or cost, contradicting this
  program's existing witness-chain and isolation disciplines.
- **Report the 1.79× figure as applying to both the 2-node/8B and
  4-node/70B configurations, matching the brief's original combined
  phrasing**: rejected outright — the evidence review's precision flag
  confirms these are two separate results in the source paper; reporting
  them combined would be an inaccurate citation this program's evidence
  discipline does not permit.

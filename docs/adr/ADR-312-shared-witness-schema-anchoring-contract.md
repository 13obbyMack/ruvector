## Context

The program's original framing (from `03-program-plan.md`'s initial draft)
proposed resolving a perceived duplication: `ruvnet/rvm`'s `rvm-witness`
crate and `ruvnet/autogenous`'s `witness` crate both implement an
append-only, hash-chained, tamper-evident log, described as having
"near-identical framing." The proposed decision was to make `rvm-witness`
canonical and have `autogenous`'s `witness` crate depend on or converge with
it.

**Direct comparison of both crates does not support that framing** (full
detail in `04-verification-addendum.md` §3):

| | `autogenous/crates/witness` | `rvm`'s `crates/rvm-witness` (vendored in `ruvector`) |
|---|---|---|
| Size | 302 LOC, one file | 4,405 LOC, multi-file |
| Hash | SHA-256 over canonical JSON | u64 chain/record hashes |
| Auth | Ed25519, per-role `SigningAuthority` | Keyed chain MAC with derivation + ratcheting |
| Record shape | JSON artifacts (genome, mutation, antibody, incident) | 64-byte cache-line-aligned records in a fixed-capacity ring buffer |
| Runtime | std, service-side, offline+deterministic | `no_std`, hypervisor-side |

The two crates are correct for their respective layers — SHA-256-over-JSON
does not fit a `no_std` 64-byte-aligned ring buffer, and `rvm-witness`'s
keyed-MAC chain is deliberately not a signature scheme suitable for
cross-service, offline verification. **Merging them, or making one depend on
the other, would be a design error**, not a simplification.

A better anchor already exists, and this program has now verified it
directly against a clone of `ruvnet/ruflo` (HEAD `fa13ee4`, 2026-08-15; 177
ADRs in `v3/docs/adr/`), not merely inherited it. `ruflo ADR-322C` (part of
the Accepted — phases-0–2-implemented — ADR-322 flywheel-integration series)
defines a receipt/ledger/verification protocol built specifically to be a
portable, offline-verifiable, cross-layer wire format: **RFC 8785 JCS
canonical JSON, SHA-256 digests, Ed25519 signatures with domain separation**
(`Ed25519(domainPrefix || 0x00 || canonicalBytes)`) — confirmed to use
**three distinct signing domains** (bootstrap, receipt, ledger-head), not
one, with explicit identity derivation (`candidateId =
SHA-256(JCS(candidate policy))`, `receiptId = SHA-256(JCS(unsigned receipt
payload))`). Every authorizing term in a 322C record carries an explicit
evidence grade — **`recomputed`, `signature-verified`, or
`trusted-assertion`** — a vocabulary this ADR adopts below for grading
anchored claims. UUIDv7 run IDs, deterministic paired-bootstrap statistical
recomputation, an O_EXCL cross-process lock with directory-fsynced
compare-and-swap, and fail-closed verification (unknown fields, non-finite
numbers, and negative zero all rejected) are likewise confirmed against
source. **This same verification pass corroborates the ADR-103 ambiguity
this program flagged elsewhere (ADR-305)**: ADR-322C line 105 states its
keys "use ADR-103's provider mechanism but a distinct purpose/domain" —
confirming the witness-manifest ADR-103 is `ruflo`'s, not `ruvector`'s.

Separately, `ruflo ADR-381` is **Proposed** (not Accepted; date 2026-08-10)
and governs a narrower scope than this ADR originally attributed to it. The
anytime-valid sequential statistical evidence scheme itself — `α_k =
α_total · 6/(π²k²)` per-test allocation so `Σα_k = α_total`, and the
measured 0.6% family-wise false-promotion rate over 1,000 simulated nulls —
belongs to **ruflo PR #2956**, which ADR-381 *governs* rather than defines:
ADR-381's own decision is (1) scoping the α ledger to the ADR-322
transaction state, one stream per project root, and (2)
`resetSequentialEvidence`, an explicit, `confirm: true`-gated, human-reasoned
**evidence-epoch** reset for budget exhaustion that expires all outstanding
receipts so stale evidence cannot be replayed against a fresh budget.
**The false-promotion bound is per-epoch, not global**: after a reset, the
guarantee is family-wise false-promotion probability ≤ `α_total` for that
epoch — any PIR document citing this bound must state it the same way.

## Decision

Resolve the witness-layer question as a **shared record schema plus a
cross-layer anchoring contract**, not a crate merge or dependency edge:

1. `rvm-witness` remains the canonical implementation for its layer —
   hypervisor-side, `no_std`, privileged-action recording. `autogenous`'s
   `witness` crate remains the canonical implementation for its layer —
   service-side, std, JSON-artifact governance records. Neither is refactored
   to depend on the other.
2. Both layers adopt **ruflo ADR-322C's canonical encoding and
   domain-separated Ed25519 signature scheme** as the shared, portable
   record format for any witness record that needs to be verified *across*
   layers — specifically, an autogenous promotion decision that needs to be
   anchored into an RVM witness chain (or vice versa) is represented using
   ADR-322C's canonical-JSON + domain-separated-Ed25519 encoding at the
   anchoring boundary, regardless of each crate's own internal
   representation.
3. Where a witness record makes a statistical claim (e.g. "this mutation's
   improvement was significant"), that claim's evidence follows ruflo PR
   #2956's anytime-valid e-process scheme (governed by ADR-381's stream
   identity and evidence-epoch reset) rather than a single uncorrected
   significance test — this is the concrete mechanism that makes "outperform
   its parent" (invariant 5) auditable across an arbitrarily long sequence of
   promotion attempts within an epoch. Any witness record's statistical
   claim is stated as a **per-epoch** bound, not a global one, and each
   authorizing term is tagged with 322C's evidence grade
   (`recomputed`/`signature-verified`/`trusted-assertion`) so a reader can
   tell which parts of the claim were independently recomputed versus merely
   asserted.
4. ruvector ADR-134's witness schema (the 64-byte cache-line-aligned,
   hash-chained record format used by `rvm-witness`) is unchanged by this
   ADR; this decision governs the boundary where a non-RVM witness record
   needs to be anchored into or verified against an RVM chain, not RVM's own
   internal format.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Avoids a design error (merging two crates built for genuinely different
  runtimes and threat models) that the original framing would have produced.
- Reuses an already-Accepted, already-implemented cross-service verification
  protocol (ruflo ADR-322C) instead of this program inventing a fifth
  witness-record format.
- Gives every PIR ADR that emits witness records (ADR-306, ADR-307, ADR-309,
  ADR-315) one anchoring contract to target, regardless of which underlying
  crate produced the record.

### Negative

- Requires cross-repo sign-off from `ruvnet/rvm`, `ruvnet/autogenous`, and
  `ruvnet/ruflo` maintainers on the shared boundary format — more
  coordination surface than a single-repo crate-dependency change would have
  been, even though it is architecturally the correct choice.
- `autogenous` self-labels "research prototype" status; adopting ruflo
  ADR-322C's format at the anchoring boundary does not itself stabilize
  autogenous's own witness crate's internal API, which may still churn.
- This ADR does not eliminate the two independent witness implementations —
  it deliberately keeps both. Anyone expecting "one witness crate for the
  whole program" from the original framing needs to be told explicitly that
  this ADR chose interoperability over consolidation.

## Security / Validation Gates

- **Witness-chain requirement**: every cross-layer anchoring event (an
  autogenous promotion record anchored into an RVM chain, or the reverse)
  must use ruflo ADR-322C's canonical encoding and produce a verifiable
  domain-separated Ed25519 signature before either side treats the record as
  committed.
- **Fail-closed verification**: unknown fields, non-finite numbers, and
  negative zero are rejected at the anchoring boundary, per ADR-322C's own
  verification rules — this program does not weaken that contract at the
  boundary.
- **Sequential-evidence discipline**: any witness record carrying a
  statistical promotion claim states its evidence per ruflo PR #2956's
  anytime-valid e-process scheme (governed by ADR-381), not a single-test
  p-value, expressed as a **per-epoch** bound, so the acceptance harness's
  (ADR-306, WP12) day-30 comparison remains statistically sound within each
  evidence epoch — a day-30-vs-day-1 comparison spanning an epoch reset must
  not silently claim a global bound it does not have.
- **Standard repo gate**: `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest security scan` after
  any change to signing, canonicalization, or verification code in either
  witness crate or the anchoring boundary.

## Affected Repos

- `ruvnet/rvm` (`rvm-witness`, unchanged internally)
- `ruvnet/autogenous` (`witness` crate, unchanged internally)
- `ruvnet/ruflo` (ADR-322/322C canonical encoding/signature scheme — Accepted; PR #2956's sequential-evidence mechanism; ADR-381's stream-identity/epoch-reset governance — Proposed; all consumed, not modified, by this ADR)
- `ruvnet/ruvector` (anchoring-boundary implementation, RVM witness consumer)

## Dependencies

Depends on ADR-305 (adopts the cross-repo coordination posture this ADR
requires). ADR-306 (Dream Machine), ADR-307 (three-level memory), ADR-309
(LatentMesh transport), and ADR-315 (constitutional gate) all depend on this
ADR for how their respective witness records get anchored across layers.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Make `autogenous`'s witness crate depend on `rvm-witness`** (the
  program's original framing): rejected — see Context; the two crates target
  incompatible runtimes (`no_std` hypervisor-side ring buffer vs. std
  service-side JSON), and forcing a dependency edge between them would
  either break `rvm-witness`'s `no_std` constraint or strip `autogenous`'s
  witness crate of the JSON/Ed25519 shape its own consumers expect.
- **Invent a new, program-specific witness schema instead of adopting ruflo
  ADR-322C's**: rejected — ADR-322C is already Accepted and implemented with
  a fail-closed verification suite; inventing a fifth schema would add
  coordination surface without adding capability.
- **Leave the two witness crates fully independent, with no anchoring
  contract at all**: rejected — this would leave invariant 3 ("every agent
  communication is attributable") and invariant 5 ("every promoted mutation
  must outperform its parent") unauditable across the autogenous/RVM
  boundary specifically, which is exactly the boundary this program's
  Governance & Constitution context needs to cross.

/**
 * AI4AI-Bench recursive-improvement adapter — first shippable slice
 * (PIR WP25, ADR-328).
 *
 * Source benchmark, cited in full on every reference (same naming discipline
 * as ADR-324 §5): AI4AI-Bench (arXiv:2608.20318, "AI4AI-Bench: Benchmarking
 * LLM Agents in Algorithmic Design for Recursive Self-Improvement";
 * github.com/Einsia/AI4AI-Bench, Apache-2.0). The benchmark freezes ten
 * research repositories spanning ten learning-algorithm families and asks an
 * agent to rewrite the learning algorithm itself; hyperparameter tuning and
 * data collection do not count as genuine improvement.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SLICE IS: the manifest/identity discipline, executor seam, score
 * ingest, and mutation-lineage chain that let MetaHarness treat AI4AI-Bench
 * (arXiv:2608.20318) tasks as an EXTERNAL published benchmark — exactly the
 * "published-benchmark" evidence kind ADR-324's external-grounding invariant
 * admits. Every candidate mutation this adapter observes carries reproducible
 * provenance (task identity → parent digest → diff digest → seed → executor
 * identity), so a run's full lineage can be replayed and audited.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SLICE IS NOT (honest scope): a real AI4AI-Bench run executes a
 * frozen repository's training pipeline inside the benchmark's own Docker
 * evaluator on datacenter-GPU hardware (the paper's official runs assume one
 * B300-class GPU). None of that happens here. The adapter takes a
 * CONSTRUCTOR-INJECTED executor (the same seam as
 * `RuvectorFlywheelOptions.benchmark` / `BenchmarkRunOptions.commandPrefixArgs`)
 * and this repo's CI exercises it only against a first-party fixture. The
 * command executor below spawns whatever evaluator entrypoint the caller
 * pins — locally that is a fixture; on real hardware it is the AI4AI-Bench
 * (arXiv:2608.20318) evaluator.
 *
 * PREPRINT-REPRODUCTION RULE (binding, unchanged from Waves 1–3): the paper's
 * published numbers — best 0.250, mean 0.166 across evaluated systems — are
 * HYPOTHESES and targets, never this program's acceptance bar. Promotion of
 * any mutation this adapter observes still routes exclusively through
 * statistics.ts `pairedBootstrapDecision` and the vetoes.ts conjunctive veto
 * algebra; an AI4AI score above 0.250 proves nothing by itself. The score
 * scale matters when reading results: 0.1 is the frozen repository's shipped
 * algorithm, so 0.250 closes less than a fifth of the ship-to-optimum
 * distance.
 *
 * FAIL-LOUD METRIC INTEGRITY (Wave-3 lesson, #888): an executor crash or a
 * non-finite / out-of-range score THROWS — it is never coerced into an
 * observation. NaN defeats every `<` comparison silently, so finiteness is
 * rejected at the choke point before any gate can see the value. Genuine-vs-
 * tuning classification is ingested only when the evaluator output carries
 * it; this adapter never fabricates the distinction.
 *
 * NO CACHING: a real AI4AI-Bench (arXiv:2608.20318) evaluation retrains a
 * stochastic pipeline; replaying a cached score as if it were a fresh run
 * would be evidence laundering. Every call to the executor is a real call.
 *
 * FROZEN WEIGHTS ARE STRUCTURAL: this file lives inside the mutation-surface
 * directory scripts/frozen-weights-check.mjs scans. It imports no weight-
 * updating API and names no model weight file. Rewriting a frozen BENCHMARK
 * repository's learning algorithm is the benchmark's task definition executed
 * by an external evaluator on external hardware — it is not a weight update
 * performed by this harness, and no path in this module persists weights.
 *
 * TRUST SCOPE (binding, stated once here and again on `Ai4aiEvidencePolicy`):
 * this module provides WITHIN-PROCESS INTEGRITY — a record cannot misreport
 * what the adapter's own executor produced. It is NOT cross-party
 * authentication: the lineage digest is unkeyed and nothing is signed, so an
 * adversary controlling the process can fabricate a chain that verifies.
 * Signing plus an issued-nonce ledger would close that; both are follow-up.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION (accepted, exact parity with benchmark.ts): the command
 * executor SIGKILLs only the spawned child, not its process group — an
 * evaluator that forks can leave orphans past the timeout. Inherited from
 * benchmark.ts's runner discipline; fixing it belongs to both call sites at
 * once, not to this adapter alone.

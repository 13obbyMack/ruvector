/**
 * SHAPER-pattern frozen-weight evolution loop — one-generation skeleton
 * (PIR WP9, ADR-313, issue #841; SHAPER = arXiv:2608.11350).
 *
 * Orchestrates ONE generation:
 *
 *   propose (Darwin/GEPA surfaces) ──► evaluate (dreamMachine.ts adapter)
 *        ──► verdict ──► promotion RECOMMENDATION (vetoes/flywheel path)
 *
 * FROZEN WEIGHTS ARE STRUCTURAL HERE, not policy:
 *   - The model-weights path is simply absent: the loop takes a
 *     `FrozenModelRef` (id + loop-start sha256, witness-recorded via the
 *     dream-machine report stamp) and no weight-file path exists anywhere in
 *     the option or result types. `MutationSurface` (genome.ts) has no
 *     "weights" member, so a weight-mutating candidate is unrepresentable.
 *   - The SAME FrozenModelRef instance is handed to both the proposer
 *     (planner role) and the evaluator (optimizer role) — SHAPER's structural
 *     claim that one frozen model serves as planner and optimizer. The result
 *     records both roles' model identity for the configuration test.
 *   - This file lives inside a mutation-surface directory enforced by
 *     scripts/frozen-weights-check.mjs: importing a training / weight-writing
 *     API here fails CI.
 *
 * CONSTITUTIONAL BOUNDARY — identical to WP2's (dreamMachine.ts, ADR-306):
 * the loop emits recommendations only. It exports no promote/merge function,
 * the result is frozen data with no callable members, and
 * test/shaperLoop.test.ts asserts both. A capability-expanding candidate is
 * additionally routed through the ADR-315 constitutional gate (stubbed in
 * genome.ts, WP11 integration point) and is BLOCKED by default.
